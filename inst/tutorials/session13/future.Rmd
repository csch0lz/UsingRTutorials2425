## Commit to Switching

-   Becoming truly proficient in R requires lots of practice.

-   We recommend to fully commit to switching whenever possible to give
    yourself the best chances of succeeding.

-   Do you need to edit, sort, or check something in an Excel sheet?
    Clean data? Make a figure? Make a table with descriptives? Run an
    analysis? â€“\> Do it in R!

::: question
Think about any ongoing or upcoming data-related projects. What could be
done in R? What not? Why?
:::

### 

### (Reference) Importing SPSS Data

SPSS data files have a complicated setup with variable labels and value
labels.

R data frames or tibbles do not have such labels.

In case you later have SPSS data that you want to analyze in R, here are
**two options** for importing SPSS data.

#### Option 1. Export from SPSS to .csv and import .csv in R.

-   Export data from SPSS to a CSV file with value labels for
    categorical variables:
    -   *File \> Export \> CSV Data* with *Save value labels where
        defined instead of data values*.
-   Use `read_csv()` (as you learned before) to import the CSV file.

::: question
Import the SPSS file `data/glbwarm.csv` and have a look at it.
:::

```{r importCSV, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
# The CSV is available in the data directory of this tutorial.
glbwarm <- read_csv("data/glbwarm.csv")
# Inspect the variables.
str(glbwarm)
```

#### Option 2. Import SPSS .sav file directly with tidyverse package `haven`.

The tidyverse package `haven` contains function `read_sav()` (or
`read_spss()`) for importing SPSS (and other software packages) data
files.

::: question
Import the SPSS file `data/glbwarm.sav` and have a look at it.
:::

```{r importSPSS, exercise = TRUE}
# The SPSS system file is available in the data directory of this tutorial.
glbwarm_spss <- haven::read_sav("data/glbwarm.sav")
# Inspect the variables.
str(glbwarm_spss)
```

### 

Imported categorical variables such as *ideology*:

-   Are numerical codes with labels.
-   So, R treats these variables as numerical.
-   If you don't want that, change them into factors.

::: question
Use the `haven::as_factor()` function to add a variable named `sex_fct`
to tibble `glbwarm_spss`.
:::

```{r sex_fct, exercise = TRUE}
# Add sex as a factor to the tibble.
glbwarm_spss <- glbwarm_spss |> 
  mutate(sex_fct = haven::as_factor(sex))
# Inspect the original and new variable.
glbwarm_spss |> count(sex, sex_fct)
```

### 

Passing the entire tibble `glbwarm_spss` to `haven::as_factor()`will
change all labelled variables into factors.

I am not sure this is what you want here. Perhaps you would like to use
the `ideology` variable as a seven-point scale.

## Keep Learning & Teaching

::: emphasis
If someone asks you: "Do you know R?", you can now proudly and
confidently say: "Yes, some of it."
:::

-   The R universe is incredibly large and versatile. Whatever
    data-related task you can come up with - there is likely going to be
    an R-based solution to your issues.

-   New projects will likely require you to learn new things in R.

-   Luckily there are lots of resources to help you develop yourself as
    an R programmer.

### 

### Documentation

-   Cheat sheets:
-   `help()` and `?` in RStudio
-   Online package documentation (e.g. for
    [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf))

### Stack Overflow (and other fora)

-   R users form a very active community.

-   Stack Overflow: Well-known forum and large archive for R questions
    (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r>)

-   Read replies for issues similar to yours or ask your own questions
    (remember to stick to the required format!)

-   Once you feel confident: Be an active part of the community.
    Contribute your own answers!

### AI 

-   AI tools are making coding easier and more convenient by the minute.
-   For instance, several AI tools can generate code based on prompts directly inside RStudio.
-   It is worth taking some time to consider the ethical implications of using AI in your work (e.g. https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics)

::: emphasis
Don't make the mistake to become a passive user. AI is only as good as the prompts you supply and it is not without its limitations. You'll need at least a basic understanding of what you are doingin R AND with the AI to accurately describe what you want and understand when the AI is making a mistake or misinterpreting your prompts.

Always double-check and test any results!
:::

###

#### Github Co-Pilot for R Studio

-   Github Co-Pilot is a new AI tool that can generate code based on prompts in form of comments directly inside RStudio.
-   It's free for UvA students.

::: question 
Step 1: Sign-up for Github Co-Pilot on Github
:::

::: question 
Step 2: Install the Github Co-Pilot extension in RStudio
:::

::: question 
Step 3: Start using Github Co-Pilot in RStudio
:::

###

Let's try it out.

::: question
Open an R Script and write the following comment: "# Add 3 to 5"
:::

::: question
Now a little more complicated: "# "
:::

```{r}
# A function that reports the result of t.test in APA format


```


[ADD exercise to write prompts for the AI and see how it does - do some
with the teacher and some on your own]

### Community

-   take and give back!

## Collaborate

various ways to collaborate - example GitHub

## Practice Open, Reproducible Science

-   Share data and code with DOI identifiers (e.g. github, OSF,
    Figshare)

-   Reproducible reports

-   Reproducible power points

## Fancy Stuff

### Shiny

The [`shiny`]() package is the RStudio contribution to interactive R
products. Actually, this tutorial is made with Shiny and it contains a
Shiny app, namely, the animated plots used in the *Evaluating a plot*
Section.

Here is the code for these plots. You cannot run the code here because
we cannot start a Shiny app from within a Shiny app (this tutorial). If
you create a new Shiny app in RStudio (*File \> New File \> Shiny Web
App*) and copy and paste the below code into the Shiny app file
(replacing all existing contents), you can run the app from RStudio (use
the *Run App* button).

::: question
Experiment with the user interface and the R code.

Check out the [Shiny demos
gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#demos) for inspiration.
Start simple!

If you want to create a Shiny app, first create your plot with
`ggplot()`, then add it to the Shiny app.
